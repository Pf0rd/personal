Projects
This website -
The creation of this website using HTML and CSS is my first attempt at web devolpment and understanding the basics. I also am an advocate for minimal web devlopment and reducing bloatware, ads, and pop ups on websites. Using basic HTML and CSS simply makes the experience heaps easier for the user, saving time and making the internet more useful.

C# Programs -
I attended Fairleigh Dickinson University for a semester where I was learning the language C#, I made countless programs including calculators, conversion charts, data entry apps, etc.
